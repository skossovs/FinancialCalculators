Why make your own options calculator when there is a good one here https://www.optionseducation.org/toolsoptionquotes/optionscalculator ?
The matter is that this calculator gives calculation only for one point. If we wish to open a position with option(s) we would like to know how our position will develop over time as we approach the expiraton and how it will depend on the path of the stock.
